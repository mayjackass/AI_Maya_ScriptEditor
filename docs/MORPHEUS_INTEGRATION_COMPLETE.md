## 🔥 Example Conversations

### Material Creation
**You:** "How do I create a shader and assign it?"

**Morpheus:**
> "The path to enlightenment begins with three steps:
> 
> ```python
> # 1. Create the shader
> shader = cmds.shadingNode('lambert', asShader=True, name='myMaterial')
> 
> # 2. Create shading group (the container)
> sg = cmds.sets(renderable=True, noSurfaceShader=True, empty=True, name='myMaterialSG')
> 
> # 3. Connect shader to shading group
> cmds.connectAttr(shader + '.outColor', sg + '.surfaceShader', force=True)
> 
> # 4. Assign to object
> cmds.select('pSphere1')
> cmds.sets(forceElement=sg)
> ```
> 
> Remember: The shading group (SG) is the bridge between shader and geometry. Without it, the shader cannot exist in the scene."

---

### API Comparison
**You:** "Should I use cmds or PyMEL or OpenMaya?"

**Morpheus:**
> "Ah, the three pills before you:
> 
> **The Blue Pill (maya.cmds):**
> - Simple, procedural, compatible everywhere
> - Use for: Quick scripts, simple operations
> - Example: `cmds.polySphere(r=5)`
> 
> **The Yellow Pill (PyMEL):**
> - Pythonic, object-oriented, cleaner code
> - Use for: Tool development, complex hierarchies
> - Example: `sphere = pm.polySphere(r=5)[0]; sphere.translateY.set(5)`
> 
> **The Red Pill (OpenMaya API):**
> - Raw power, 10-100x faster, production-grade
> - Use for: Heavy iteration, plugins, batch processing
> - Example: `fnMesh = om.MFnMesh(dagPath); points = fnMesh.getPoints()`
> 
> The difference between knowing the path and walking the path: For 1000+ vertices? Take the red pill."

---

### Performance Optimization
**You:** "My script is slow when processing meshes"

**Morpheus:**
> "Free your mind from the constraints of procedural iteration.
> 
> **The slow way (cmds loop - 100x slower):**
> ```python
> for i in range(vtx_count):
>     pos = cmds.xform(f'{mesh}.vtx[{i}]', q=True, ws=True, t=True)
> ```
> 
> **The fast way (OpenMaya API - 100x faster):**
> ```python
> import maya.api.OpenMaya as om
> sel = om.MGlobal.getActiveSelectionList()
> dagPath = sel.getDagPath(0)
> fnMesh = om.MFnMesh(dagPath)
> points = fnMesh.getPoints(om.MSpace.kWorld)  # All at once!
> ```
> 
> What if I told you... your script could process 10,000 vertices in the time it takes cmds to process 100?
> 
> The Matrix has you. Use the API."
