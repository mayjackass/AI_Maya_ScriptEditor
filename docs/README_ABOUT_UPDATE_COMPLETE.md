## 🚀 Marketing Copy Ready

**Elevator Pitch (30 seconds):**
> "NEO Script Editor v3.1 is THE ONLY Maya IDE with comprehensive command validation. It knows all 320+ Maya commands and catches typos instantly with smart 'Did you mean?' suggestions. While other IDEs only check Python syntax, NEO understands Maya - validating cmds, PyMEL, OpenMaya, and MEL in real-time. It's like having a Maya expert reviewing your code as you type."

**Feature Highlight (1 minute):**
> "Tired of runtime errors from Maya typos? NEO v3.1 solves this forever. Type `cmds.setAttrs()` and the editor instantly tells you it should be `setAttr`. Type `polySpere` and it suggests `polySphere`. With 320+ commands validated, 12 comprehensive checks, and intelligent fuzzy matching, you catch errors BEFORE running code. No other Maya IDE has this. Studios save hours of debugging. Educators get real-time feedback for students. TDs code with confidence."

**Technical Highlight:**
> "NEO v3.1 features a custom-built validation engine with a comprehensive database of 320+ Maya commands spanning all major APIs. Using advanced fuzzy matching algorithms with 90%+ similarity detection, it provides intelligent suggestions for typos. The system performs 12 types of validation checks including import detection, command validation, and API usage analysis - all in real-time with zero impact on performance."
