# Line Navigation Fix - Complete

## Problem
When double-clicking errors in the Problems window, the cursor was jumping to the wrong line (line 11 instead of line 14).

## Root Cause
The navigation code was using `findBlockByLineNumber()` which has inconsistent behavior. The method was returning incorrect block numbers when the file had been modified in the editor but not saved to disk.

**Key Issue**: 
- Python's `compile()` reports: Line 14 has error
- `findBlockByLineNumber(13)` returned: Block 10 (line 11)
- Expected: Block 13 (line 14)

## Solution
Changed from `findBlockByLineNumber()` to `findBlockByNumber()` which directly uses the block index.

### Before (Broken):
```python
block = target_editor.document().findBlockByLineNumber(line_num - 1)
```

### After (Fixed):
```python
block = target_editor.document().findBlockByNumber(line_num - 1)
```

## Changes Made

### 1. **main_window.py** - `_on_problem_double_clicked()`
- **Line ~600**: Changed to use `findBlockByNumber()` instead of `findBlockByLineNumber()`
- Removed all debug print statements
- Simplified navigation logic

### 2. **editor/code_editor.py** - `_check_syntax_errors()`
- **Lines ~427-445**: Removed complex backwards search logic for parenthesis errors
- Now trusts Python's `compile()` line numbers directly
- Removed debug print statements
- Simplified error detection flow

### 3. **ai/chat.py** - `_validate_morpheus_suggestion()`
- **Line ~604**: Removed `[DEBUG]` print statement
- Cleaned up console messages

## Technical Details

### Qt Block Numbering
- Blocks are 0-indexed internally
- Display line numbers are 1-indexed
- `findBlockByNumber(n)` gets block at index n
- `findBlockByLineNumber(n)` searches for line n (unreliable when document modified)

### Error Detection Flow
1. Python's `compile()` detects syntax error on line X
2. Store line number X in Problems window
3. User double-clicks error
4. Navigate to block X-1 (convert 1-indexed line to 0-indexed block)
5. Cursor positioned at start of that block

## Testing
✅ Error detection works correctly
✅ Problems window shows correct line numbers  
✅ Double-click navigation goes to correct line
✅ Morpheus AI applies fixes to correct line
✅ Red highlighting appears on correct line

## Performance
- Removed unnecessary backwards searching through file
- Simplified error detection (trust Python's line numbers)
- Removed verbose debug logging
- Overall cleaner and faster code

## Files Modified
- `main_window.py` - Line navigation fix
- `editor/code_editor.py` - Error detection cleanup
- `ai/chat.py` - Debug code removal
