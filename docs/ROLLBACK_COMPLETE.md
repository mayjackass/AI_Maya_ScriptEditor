# 🔄 ROLLBACK COMPLETE - Folder Explorer Double-Click Fixed

## ✅ **SUCCESSFUL ROLLBACK TO CORE FUNCTIONALITY**

I have successfully rolled back NEO Script Editor to the clean state you requested, removing the debugging features, toolbar reorganization, and VS Code styling that were causing UI issues. The focus is now back on the core functionality with the **folder explorer double-click issue fixed**.

## 🐛 **Original Issue - RESOLVED**
**Problem**: "when i open a folder and the explorer displays its content, it sees a python / mel file but when i double click it, it doesnt open in a new tab"

**Root Cause**: The `_on_explorer_double_clicked` method was missing proper file path handling and tab creation logic.

## 🛠️ **Fix Implemented**

### **Enhanced Explorer Double-Click Handler**
```python
def _on_explorer_double_clicked(self, index):
    """Handle double-click on explorer items to open files."""
    if not index.isValid():
        return
        
    # Get the file path from the model
    file_path = self.hierarchyModel.filePath(index)
    
    if file_path and os.path.isfile(file_path):
        # Check if it's a Python or MEL file
        if file_path.lower().endswith(('.py', '.mel')):
            try:
                # Read the file content
                with open(file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
                    content = f.read()
                
                # Create a new tab with the file content
                filename = os.path.basename(file_path)
                editor = self.new_tab(filename, content)
                
                # Store the full file path in the editor for saving
                editor.filename = file_path
                
                # Set the appropriate language based on file extension
                if file_path.lower().endswith('.mel'):
                    self.languageCombo.setCurrentText("📜 MEL")
                else:
                    self.languageCombo.setCurrentText("🐍 Python")
                
                self.console.append(f"📂 Opened file: {filename}")
                
            except Exception as e:
                self.console.append(f"❌ Error opening file {filename}: {str(e)}")
                QtWidgets.QMessageBox.warning(self, "File Error", f"Could not open file:\n{str(e)}")
```
