## 🎯 Benefits of New Structure

1. **Cleaner Root Directory**
   - Only essential files in root
   - Easy to find main entry points
   - Professional appearance

2. **Better Organization**
   - Documentation in `docs/`
   - Tests in `tests/`
   - Scripts in `scripts/`
   - Clear separation of concerns

3. **Proper Git Tracking**
   - Only essential files tracked on GitHub
   - Local development files stay local
   - Cleaner repository

4. **Easier Maintenance**
   - Find files quickly
   - Know what's tracked and what's not
   - Consistent structure

## 📝 Updated .gitignore

Added to .gitignore:
- `SIMPLE_FIX_STRATEGY.md` (now in docs/)
- `CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md` (in docs/)
- `scripts/` folder
- `cleanup_project.ps1`

Already ignored:
- `docs/` folder
- `tests/` folder
- `archive/` folder
- Various development files

## 🚀 What's on GitHub vs Local

### Tracked on GitHub (Public):
- Core application code (`ai/`, `editor/`, `ui/`, `utils/`)
- Assets and icons
- Main documentation (README, MAYA_SETUP, RELEASE_NOTES)
- Main launcher (`run.py`)
- License files
- Maya shelf button

### Local Only (Not Tracked):
- `docs/` - All additional documentation
- `tests/` - All test files
- `scripts/` - PowerShell utility scripts
- `run_dev.py` - Development launcher
- `maya_dev_launcher.py` - Maya dev tools
- `userSetup.py` - User-specific Maya setup
- `.venv/` - Virtual environment
- Cache files and temporary files
