# NEO Script Editor v2.0 - Complete Bug Fixes & Improvements

## ÔøΩ CRITICAL FIXES IMPLEMENTED

### 1. ‚úÖ Line Numbering Restoration
- **Problem**: Line numbers disappeared due to conflicting `resizeEvent` methods
- **Solution**: Consolidated resize event handling for both line numbers and search widget
- **Result**: Line numbers now display properly with error dots

### 2. ‚úÖ Enhanced Error Detection System  
- **Problem**: Only detected single errors, no visual indicators on line numbers
- **Solution**: 
  - Implemented multi-error detection with line-by-line syntax checking
  - Added red error dots on line numbers for lines with errors
  - Enhanced error tracking with `_error_lines` set
  - Improved bracket/parentheses matching detection
- **Result**: Multiple errors detected simultaneously with clear visual indicators

### 3. ‚úÖ Morpheus Code Block Display Fixed
- **Problem**: AI-generated code blocks not rendering properly
- **Solution**:
  - Improved regex pattern for code block detection: `r'```(?:(\w+)\n)?(.*?)```'`
  - Fixed text/code parsing with proper loop handling
  - Enhanced debug logging for code block processing
  - Added proper HTML escaping and formatting
- **Result**: Code blocks now display with syntax highlighting and Apply buttons

### 4. ‚úÖ Chat Message Separation Enhanced
- **Problem**: User and AI messages appeared on same line without clear separation
- **Solution**:
  - Added `<br>` tags before and after message containers
  - Enhanced visual styling with colored left borders 
  - Improved spacing and typography
  - Added proper line breaks between consecutive messages
- **Result**: Clear visual separation with proper line spacing

### 5. ‚úÖ Chat Syntax Error Fixed
- **Problem**: `returns` instead of `return` in chat.py causing syntax error
- **Solution**: Fixed typo in line 70 of ai/chat.py

### 2. ‚úÖ Chat Visual Separation Improved 
- **Problem**: User and AI messages not visually distinct enough
- **Solution**: 
  - Enhanced user messages with blue left border and better padding
  - Enhanced AI messages with green left border and improved spacing
  - Added proper icons and better typography
  - Increased margins between messages (16px vs 8px)

### 3. ‚úÖ Enhanced Error Detection System
- **Problem**: Could only detect one error, no red dots on line numbers
- **Solution**:
  - Implemented multi-error detection system
  - Added line-by-line syntax checking for brackets, parentheses
  - Added red error dots on line numbers for lines with errors
  - Enhanced line number area with error visualization
  - Errors tracked in `_error_lines` set for persistent display

### 4. ‚úÖ Status Indicator Repositioned & Resized
- **Problem**: Status stayed "Thinking..." and was too large
- **Solution**:
  - Moved status indicator below chat input (smaller, centered)
  - Reduced font size from 10pt to 9pt
  - Proper status reset to "üß† Ready" after AI response
  - Updated styling for compact display

### 5. ‚úÖ Chat History Controls Moved to Top
- **Problem**: History navigation was at bottom, not prominent
- **Solution**:
  - Moved chat history navigation to top of chat panel
  - Positioned right below "Morpheus Chat" title
  - Improved button styling and spacing

### 6. ‚úÖ Language Selector Relocated & Enhanced
- **Problem**: Language selector cluttered toolbar
- **Solution**:
  - Moved language selector to dedicated tab bar header area
  - Added language icons: üêç Python, üìú MEL
  - Tab titles now show language icons (like Maya Script Editor)
  - Improved combo box styling with VS Code theme
  - Cleaner toolbar without language clutter

### 7. ‚úÖ VS Code-Style Inline Search
- **Problem**: Search was separate dialog, not integrated
- **Solution**:
  - Implemented VS Code-style inline search widget
  - Appears at top-right when pressing Ctrl+F
  - Includes find previous/next navigation
  - Escape key to close, Enter for next match
  - Real-time search as you type
  - Removed search from toolbar (now Ctrl+F only)

### 8. ‚úÖ Simplified Error Checking
- **Problem**: Both "Lint" and "Check Errors" were redundant
- **Solution**:
  - Removed redundant "Lint" functionality from toolbar and menu
  - Kept only "Check Errors" which is more comprehensive
  - Cleaner toolbar with focused error detection

## üöÄ New Features Added

### Language Detection & Auto-Switching
- Auto-detects .py vs .mel files when opening
- Tab icons automatically update based on file type
- Language combo updates when switching files

### Enhanced File Operations  
- File dialogs support both Python and MEL files
- Smart default extensions based on selected language
- Language auto-detection from file extensions

### VS Code-Style Error Visualization
- Red wavy underlines for syntax errors
- Red dots on line numbers for error lines
- Multi-error detection and highlighting
- Persistent error display until fixed

### Improved UI Layout
- Compact status indicator below input
- History controls at top for easy access
- Language selector in dedicated header area
- Cleaner, more focused toolbar

## üìã Usage Instructions

### Language Switching
1. Use language selector in tab bar header (üêç Python / üìú MEL)
2. Tab titles automatically show language icons
3. Syntax highlighting updates in real-time

### Search Functionality  
1. Press **Ctrl+F** to open inline search
2. Type to search, Enter for next match
3. Use arrow buttons or Shift+Enter for navigation
4. Press Escape to close search

### Error Detection
1. Errors automatically detected as you type
2. Red dots appear on line numbers with errors
3. Red wavy underlines on problematic code
4. Use **Ctrl+E** for manual error checking

### MEL vs Python Execution
1. Select language from dropdown
2. Press **F5** to run entire script
3. Press **F9** to run selection
4. Language determines execution method (Python exec() vs MEL eval())

## üß™ Testing

Run `test_improvements.py` to verify all features work correctly. The script includes:
- Language switching tests
- Error detection validation  
- Search functionality verification
- Chat and status indicator testing
