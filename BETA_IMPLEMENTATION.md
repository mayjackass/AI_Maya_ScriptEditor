## Files Created

### Core Implementation
```

├── __init__.py              # Module initializer
└── beta_manager.py          # Main beta management logic

## How It Works

### Startup Flow
```
1. App launches
2. BetaManager checks expiration date
3. If expired → Show blocking dialog → Close app
4. If expiring soon → Show warning (once per day)
5. Update window title with beta suffix
6. Display status in status bar
```

### Warning Levels
```
Days Remaining    | Action
------------------|---------------------------------
> 14 days         | Normal operation, status bar info
7-14 days         | Daily warning dialogs
1-7 days          | Urgent warnings, red text
0 days (expired)  | Block application access
```

---

## Customization Options

### Change Expiry Date
**File:** `license/beta_manager.py`
```python
BETA_EXPIRY_DATE = "2026-01-31"  # Change this date
```

### Change Warning Thresholds
**File:** `license/beta_manager.py`
```python
WARNING_DAYS = 14  # Start warnings X days before
URGENT_DAYS = 7    # Urgent warnings X days before
```

### Change Purchase URL
**File:** `license/beta_manager.py`
```python
def _open_purchase_page(self):
    webbrowser.open("YOUR_SALES_PAGE_URL")
```

### Change Contact Email

```python
BETA_EXPIRY_DATE = "2025-10-01"  # Past date
```

### Check Beta Info Dialog
